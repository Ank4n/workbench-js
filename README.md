This repository serves as a simple collection of useful scripts for the KILT Spiritnet.

 ⚠️ None of the scripts have been audited and were only used in dev environments, so use them at your own risk. ⚠️

All scripts require you to have [NodeJs installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend an LTS version like `16.13.1`.
